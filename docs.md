  Introduction
============
This API is responsible for converting JSON variables to REGO which in turn is used in application policy management. The policy management application is born from the need to manage Open Policy Agent ( OPA ) policies written in REGO from a user interface for non-technical users and an API through JSON for technical users.

  Features
============
   - Translating JSON to REGO
   - CRUD operations for policies for persistence.
   - Supports existing policies for editing.
   - Supports creating new policies from scratch.

   Architecture
   ============
   The architecture of the API is based on the following principles:
   - The API is written in Python and FastAPI framework.
   - The API is written in a way that it is easy to use, extend, test and maintain.

   Installation
   ============
- Manual installation - Available [Here](https://github.com/r-scheele/rego_builder#readme)

- Build your own image and start the container -
   ```bash
   $ Configure environment variables - the .env file
   $ docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

   ```
- Pull the official image from Docker Hub - and start the container 

   ```bash
   $ docker pull rscheele3214/rego-builder:latest
   $ docker run rscheele3214/rego-builder:latest
   ```


How the translation from JSON to REGO works?
============
The REGO policies are created by a set of functions that serves as the translation logic, They're called commands. Each of these commands is responsible for writing specific REGO rule to a `.rego` file. However, the JSON to REGO conversion must follow certain conditions as defined by a pydantic model for effectiveness. The following is an example of how a rule is defined:

   ```json     
   {
      "command": "input_prop_equals",
      "properties": {
         "input_property": "request_method",
         "value": "GET"
      }
   }
   ```
In this case, The command key represents the operation to be performed and the properties key represents the properties that are being used in the operation.
`input_prop_equals` is the command in example, which initiates the appropriate operation, on the properties object.
The above rule translates to an equality check between the input_property and the value. <br />
The REGO equivalent of the above rule object is: <br />
   `input.request_method == "GET"`

### As of now, the API supports the following commands:
1. input_prop_equals
2. input_prop_in
3. input_prop_in_as
4. allow_full_access


Usage
============
### Detailed explanation of commands with examples: 


## 1. Input_props_equals
   This command has different logic to handle series of equality checks.
  ### - Handling '*' as the wildcard flag: <br /> 

   This logic handles all the paths after a particular section. if `/collections/` is supplied as the option, all the routes after it will be allowed e.g allow `/collections/obs/`, allow `/collections/test-data/obs/`, allow `/collections/obs/` etc. <br /> 

   Rule is simply written as: <br />
   `allow { 
      input.request_path = /collections/...
   }` <br />  and the rule object is:
   ```json     
   {
      "command": "input_prop_equals",
      "properties": {
         "input_property": "request_path",
         "value": ["v1", "collections", "*"]
      }
   }
   ```
   ### - Allowing all path parameter after a path section, except one: <br /> 

   If a particular path parameter is to be exempted, the command matches all other parameters aside the exempted one. e.g allow `/collections/obs/`, allow `/collections/test-data/obs/`, allow `/collections/obs/`. deny `/collections/lakes/`. <br /> 

   Rule is simply written as: <br />
   `allow {
      input.request_path = /collections/...
   }` <br /> 
   `deny {
      input.request_path = /collections/lakes
   }` <br /> 
   and the rule object is:
   ```json
   {
      "command": "input_prop_equals",
      "properties": {
         "input_property": "request_path",
         "value": ["v1", "collections", "*"],
         "exceptional_value": "obs",
      },
   }
   ```
   ### -  Handling equality check between a particular property on the request object and a value: <br />

   `allow {
      input.company = 'Geobeyond srl'
       }` <br /> 
   and the rule object is:
   ```json
   {
      "command": "input_prop_equals",
      "properties": {
         "input_property": "company",
         "value": "Geobeyond srl"
      }
   }
   ```

 ### -  Allow access to a particular path: <br />
 This command is to allow access to a particular path e.g `/v1/collections/obs` if the property of the request equals certain value<br />

   `allow {
  input.request_path == ["v1", "collections", "lakes", ""] input.groupname == "admin"
}` <br /> 
   and the rule object is:
   ```json
   [
      {
         "command": "input_prop_equals",
         "properties": {
            "input_property": "request_path",
            "value": ["v1", "collections", "lakes"],
         },
      },
       {
         "command": "input_prop_equals",
         "properties": {
            "input_property": "request_path",
            "value": "admin",
         },
      }
   ]
   ```
   ## 2. Input_props_in
   This command is to check if a particular property on the request object is in a list of values from the database. <br />

   `allow {
        input.company == data.items[i].name
   }` <br /> 
   and the rule object is:
   ```json
   {
      "command": "input_prop_in",
      "properties": {
         "input_property": "company",
         "datasource_name": "items",
         "datasource_loop_variable": "name"
      }
}
   ```
   ## 3. Input_props_in_as
   This command is to check if two properties on the request object is present on the same object in the database <br />


   `allow {
         some i \n
         data.items[i].name == input.preferred_username \n
         data.items[i].everyone == input.groupname 
   }` <br /> 
   and the rule object is:
   ```json
 {
      "command": "input_prop_in_as",
      "properties": {
         "datasource_name": "items",
         "datasource_loop_variables": ["name", "everyone"],
         "input_properties": ["preferred_username", "groupname"]
      }
 }
   ```


## 4. allow_full_access
   This command is to allow full access to the resource, if the property on the request object has a particular value<br />


   `allow {
  input.groupname == "EDITOR_ATAC"
}
   }` <br /> 
   and the rule object is:
   ```json
   [
      {
         "command": "allow_full_access",
         "properties": {
            "input_property": "groupname",
            "value": "EDITOR_ATAC",
         },
      }
   ]
   ```


   API CRUD Operations
   ============

   The API is designed to support all CRUD operations that makes interaction with the policies easy. The following routes are currently defined:

 ###  - POST `/policies/`  üóù
Using the JSON defined from the frontend, this route is used to build a new policy. The response will be a REGO file written and pushed to github as a newly established remote repository, with the request body conforming to a specified syntax described by the pydantic model `Policy`. <br />
```py3
class Policy:
    name: str
    rules: List[List[Rule]]
```
Rule Object: <br />
```py3
class Rule(BaseModel):
    command: str
    properties: Dict[str, Union[str, List[str], Dict[str, Union[str, List[str]]]]]
```

Each Rule object forms a specific rule in a Allow block, and a list of Rules forms a Allow block. <br />
```py3
List[Rule] == Allow {
   ...
}
```
A typical request body which will contain multiple allow blocks in the REGO rule would be: <br />
   ```json
   {
   "name": "Example2",
   "rules": [
      [
         {
         "command": "input_prop_equals",
         "properties": {
            "input_property": "request_path",
            "value": [
               "v1",
               "collections",
               "*"
            ],
            "exceptional_value": "obs"
         }
         },

               "*"
            ]

            ],
            "data_input_properties": [
               "preferred_username",
               "groupname"
            ]
         }
         }

      [
         {
         "command": "allow_full_access",
         "properties": {
            "input_property": "groupname",
            "value": "EDITOR_ATAC"
         }
         }
      ],
      [
         {
         "command": "input_prop_equals",
         "properties": {
            "input_property": "groupname",
            "value": [
               "v1",
               "collections",
               "test-data"
            ]
         }
         },
         {
         "command": "allow_full_access",
         "properties": {

            }
         }
      ]
   ]}

   ```
 ###  - GET `/policies/` üóù
This route is used to get all policies that have been created. The response will be a list of all policies that have been created by a certain user, and contains all the associating rules with the policy <br />

```py3
List[Policy]   
   ```

   ###  - GET PUT DELETE `/policies/{policy_name}` üóù
   GET - This request method is used to get a specific policy by name. The response will be a policy object conforming to the pydantic model `Policy`. <br />
   PUT - This request method is used to update a specific policy by name. The response will be a policy object conforming to the pydantic model `Policy`. <br />
   DELETE - This request method is used to delete a specific policy by name
